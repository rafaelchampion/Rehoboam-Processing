# Rehoboam-Processing
 
Replication of Westworld's Rehoboam interface using Processing

Current state:

• Ramdomness generated with additive waves incresing the wave's phase clockwise and counterclockwise
• Starting the developement of the divergencies

Next steps:

• Make divergencies into objects;
• Randomly generate divergencies (will opt in the future for generate divergencies randomly or with scripted events (click, keyboard input or smart home sensors);
• Make divergencies interact with the waves making the interface more visually upsetting (more chaotic waves);
• Fix minor visual inconsistencies;
• Apply some form of texturing into the waves to replicate the original's dotted pattern (not yet sure if shifting to work with particles due to poor performance);
• Refactor some rushed code;
• Improve framerate;
