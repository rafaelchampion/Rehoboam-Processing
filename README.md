# Rehoboam-Processing
 
Replication of Westworld's Rehoboam interface using Processing

Current state:

<ul>
 <li>Ramdomness generated with additive waves incresing the wave's phase clockwise and counterclockwise;</li>
 <li>Starting the developement of the divergencies;</li>
</ul>

Preview:

Next steps:

<ul>
 <li>Make divergencies into objects;</li>
 <li>Randomly generate divergencies (will opt in the future for generate divergencies randomly or with scripted events (click, keyboard input or smart home sensors);</li>
 <li>Make divergencies interact with the waves making the interface more visually upsetting (more chaotic waves);</li>
 <li>Fix minor visual inconsistencies;</li>
 <li>Apply some form of texturing into the waves to replicate the original's dotted pattern (not yet sure if shifting to work with particles due to poor performance);</li>
 <li>Refactor some rushed code;</li>
 <li>Improve framerate;</li>
<ul>
